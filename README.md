# Ensemble5 User Testing

This project is an empty Angular application so UX can conduct Developer User testing on a beta release of Ensemble 5

If you don not have access to push a branch to this repo, try harder. Just kidding, contact Robbie.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
